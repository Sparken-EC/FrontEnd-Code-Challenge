# Sparken - Code Test

Welcome! This repository contains the technical test for developer candidates at Sparken. The test aims to evaluate your skills with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Sass**. Below you will find the instructions and steps needed to set up and complete the test.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - A React framework for web applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework for creating fast and customisable interfaces.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - A CSS preprocessor for advanced style management.

## 📦 Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the development environment:

1. **Fork** this repository to work on your own version.
2. Clone your forked repository:

    ```bash
   git@github.com:your-username/FrontEnd-Code-Challenge.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd your-repo

4. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
   ```
   or

    ```bash
    npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    bun dev
   ```
   or

    ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```

6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

🚀 Challenge Requirements

Your task is to create an application that meets the following criteria:

1.	Responsive Design: Use Tailwind CSS to create a design that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
2.	Modular Styles: Use Sass to handle more complex styles, employing variables, mixins, or functions as necessary.
3.	Componentisation: Structure the application in a modular fashion with reusable React components.
4.	Optimisation: The application should be fast and optimised for a good user experience.

🧪 Testing

The implementation of automated tests using the following is valued:

- Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Jest for unit and integration testing.

📋 Rules and Considerations

- The code should be clean, well-structured, and follow best development practices.
- Use Next.js for handling routing and pages.
- Styles should primarily be managed with Tailwind CSS, while any advanced style customisation should be handled with Sass.
- Avoid unnecessary additional libraries; the goal is to evaluate your mastery of the core technologies.
